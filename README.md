# Surface-Temperature-Change-Data-Analysis
The attached .ipynb file is from a Google Collab project where the goal was to predict surface temperature change in countries based off of other data. This can allow us to see which countries and regions are most at risk from temperature increases. 

The project has three parts:
  The first part was to load the kaggle datasets and clean the data 
  The second part was EDA and by creating visualizations using techniques such as K-means clustering and t-SNE we were able to find underlying structures     and trends in the data.
  The third part was running different regression models on the cleaned data to see which models were great at predicting temperature change and which were   not good.
  Our of our models suffered partially from overfitting.
